This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.appOwnership` property within a React Native app.  The property sometimes returns `undefined` instead of the expected boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the app is owned by the user or installed from an external source. This leads to unexpected behavior in conditional rendering or logic based on app ownership. The inconsistency seems to appear randomly across different builds and devices.
