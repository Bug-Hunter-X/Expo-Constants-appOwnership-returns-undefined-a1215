```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

const checkAppOwnership = () => {
  const ownership = Constants.appOwnership;
  //Fallback mechanism to handle undefined
  return ownership !== undefined ? ownership : false; //Default to false if undefined
};

//Example usage:
const Component = () => {
  const isOwned = checkAppOwnership();
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>App Ownership: {isOwned ? 'Owned' : 'Not Owned'}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
