# Expo Constants.appOwnership Returns Undefined

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `Constants.appOwnership` property in Expo sometimes returns `undefined` instead of a boolean. This issue causes unpredictable behavior in conditional logic within the application.

## Bug Description

The `Constants.appOwnership` property is expected to return `true` if the app is owned by the user (installed from the app store) and `false` otherwise (installed from an external source).  However, in certain circumstances, it returns `undefined`, leading to errors and unexpected behavior. This appears to be inconsistent across different builds and devices.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an iOS or Android device/simulator. 
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of the appOwnership check.

## Solution

A robust solution is provided in `bugSolution.js` which uses a fallback mechanism to ensure that a boolean value is always used in conditional statements.
